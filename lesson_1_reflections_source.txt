How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

When a problem occurs you can quickly see what changes you made.  
you do not have to rely on memory and sometimes a change was 
made inadvertantly to code you are not working on. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: Control, can package your changes in logical groupings 
that make sense when restoring
Cons: Can wait to long and have to recreate code.  Not a great 
backup version for losing hard drive. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It is better suited to programming where different files 
are interrelated. In google docs, being intererelated would be
rare. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you a history of the changes. git diff shows you the c
changes that were done for each change. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

need to create the .git file so that the system can track 
the different versions

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where you decide which files will be
updated in the commit. It allows you to make changes 
and save them until you are ready to commit as a group. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you 
have one commit per logical change?

You can make all your changes and move them at once as a
unit. You can use status to make sure you did not miss
anything or something needs to be backed out.
